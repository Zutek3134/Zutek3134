            <p>Each question consists of a vocabulary and four options. The goal is to match the correct translation to the given word.</p>
            <p>The word bank used is provided from the handout published by my school and the textbook which our school uses.</p>
            <h2 class="mar">II. Settings</h2>
            <h3 class="mar">1. Rude Mode</h3>
            <p>
                Once enabled, every string in the game becomes somewhat rude.
                For example, <q><span class="twemoji"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twitter/twemoji/master/assets/svg/1f913.svg"></span>You've guessed</q> when the user answers the question correctly.
                When this feature was released, it appealed to many; people provided and suggested a lot more offensive messages.
                However, in order to pass the quality check, many messages had to be tweaked and rewritten.
                People were not amused.
                To quote the description of this setting in-game:
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-quote">
                <div class="alert-icon"></div>
                <div class="alert-message">慎入。如果你享受別人罵、嗆你，就可以開啟此選項。</div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="mar">2. Disable Transitions</h3>
            <p>
                There are many well-designed animations and transitions in-game.
                Yet not everyone can run them smoothly.
                To quote the description of this setting in-game:
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-quote">
                <div class="alert-icon"></div>
                <div class="alert-message">如果你不要動畫，或是用了會卡又懶得換裝置，開啟。</div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="mar">3. Range Selection</h3>
            <p>
                The word bank used is provided from the handout published by my school and the textbook which our school uses.
                There are three categories of vocabularies, Hsueh Tse, Chih Kau, and Textbook.
                Additionally, idioms and phrases are included in the Textbook category.
                In the selection menu, ranges are chosen by toggling pages.
                There is also an Exam Range button available.
                Just enable it to review the entire exam vocabularies.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mar">4. Game Settings</h3>
            <ol class="h4">
                <li>
                    <h4>Number of Questions</h4>
                    <p>This controls the number of questions in the game. The range is 5 to 30.</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-bulb">
                        <div class="alert-icon"></div>
                        <div class="alert-message">If there are not enough questions available in the chosen pages, this field is ignored and the game ends earlier.</div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Review All</h4>
                    <p>
                        When enabled, every single question from the selected pages will show up.
                        If there are way too many questions (eg. 100) then the game will double check with the user.

                    </p>
                    <div class="alert alert-warning">
                        <div class="alert-icon"></div>

                    <h4>Wrong Questions Review</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you answered a question wrongly, then it will show up in the end again, and will continue to do so until answered correctly.
                        If you did not have a perfect run, then you will answer more question than expected.
                    <div class="alert alert-eg">
                        <div class="alert-icon"></div>
                        <div class="alert-message">Eg. A player sets to play 5 questions. However, they’ve gotten 1 question wrong. The game reviews this question again, and assuming they got it correct the second time, they would have answered 6 questions in total.</div>
                    </div>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="mar">III. Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                Questions show up alternately in English and Mandarin, and the player has to choose the correct meaning/vocabulary.
                The game will mark an answer as <q>lucky</q> if it took the user longer than usual to answer.
                Then, it will prompt the user to answer it one more time after all questions are answered.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-bulb">
                <div class="alert-icon"></div>
                <div class="alert-message">In order to not frustrate the user, a maximum of 1 lucky-answered question would be asked each game.</div>
            </div>
            <p>The game will calculate <q>Accuracy (%),</q> <q>Correct (questions),</q> <q>Maximum Combo (questions),</q> and <q>Average Time (seconds).</q>
                What’s more, the background changes based on the accuracy. The higher the accuracy, the happier and more lively the background.</p>

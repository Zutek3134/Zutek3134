### 📝 Facts...
1. The name "Zutek" means nothing. It is just random. Very random.
2. The tag "3134" was the verification number when I was creating my account.
3. Believe it or not but my Discord tag is also "#3134" by default. Lucky.
4. I have been making games since I was around 10 years old.
5. I know Chinese, English, Hokkien, Japanese, and French. But I am only very fluent in the first two.
6. I don't study in school. Because when I do, whatever I read won't be on the test.
7. Number 6 is horrifyingly true. I have studied the entire textbook (which I was already good at) for the national exam and there were 0 questions about it the next day.
8. I say random things randomly.
9. I surf the official Mandarin Dictionary distributed by the Ministry of Education often, for fun.
10. I use GitHub as personal wiki.
